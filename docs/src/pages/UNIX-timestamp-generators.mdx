# UNIX timestamp generators.
A set of functions to help with generating random UNIX timestamp values. 
Generators can return a single value or grouped values using arrays and matrix. 

---

## _rndmTimestamp()
Generate a random UNIX timestamp value.
<Properties>
  <Property name="year" type="int">
    Set a custom year, instead of random value. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="month" type="int">
    Set a custom month, instead of random value. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="day" type="int">
    Set a custom day, instead of random value. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="hour" type="int">
    Set a custom hour, instead of random value. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="minute" type="int">
    Set a custom minute, instead of random value. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="second" type="int">
    Set a custom second, instead of random value. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="returns" type="int">
    A random UNIX timestamp value.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## _rndmTimestampArray()
Generate a random integer array of UNIX timestamp values.
<Properties>
  <Property name="size" type="int">
    The size of the array. By default its set to 0, which implies a random length between 3-10 values. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="year" type="int">
    Set a custom year, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="month" type="int">
    Set a custom month, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="day" type="int">
    Set a custom day, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="hour" type="int">
    Set a custom hour, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="minute" type="int">
    Set a custom minute, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="second" type="int">
    Set a custom second, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="returns" type="array<int>">
    A random integer array of UNIX timestamp values.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## _rndmTimestampMatrix()
Generate a random integer matrix of UNIX timestamp values.
<Properties>
  <Property name="rows" type="int">
    Total row size. By default its set to 0, which implies a random length between 3-10 values. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="columns" type="int">
    Total column size. By default its set to 0, which implies a random length between 3-10 values. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="year" type="int">
    Set a custom year, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="month" type="int">
    Set a custom month, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="day" type="int">
    Set a custom day, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="hour" type="int">
    Set a custom hour, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="minute" type="int">
    Set a custom minute, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="second" type="int">
    Set a custom second, instead of random values. By default its set to 0, which implies random. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="returns" type="matrix<int>">
    A random integer matrix of UNIX timestamp values.
  </Property>
</Properties>
