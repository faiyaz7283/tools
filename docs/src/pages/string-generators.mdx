# String generators.
A set of functions to help with generating random types of string data. 
Generators can return a single value or grouped values using arrays and matrix.

## _rndmChar()
Generate a single random character from a-z. 
<Properties>
  <Property name="returns" type="string">
    A random character (a-z).

<Properties>
  <Property name="len" type="int">
    The length of the string. By default its set to 0, which implies a random length between 3-10. _Optional. The default is 0_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="returns" type="string">
    A random string.
  </Property>
</Properties>

  </Property>
  <Property name="returns" type="string">
    A random word.
  </Property>
</Properties>
